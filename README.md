# Switched-Capacitor-BGREF
In This project I will show the design of Switched Capacitor (SC) Bandgap reference voltage (BGREF) in 65[nm] technology.
This project was part of a final design in Analog Integrated Course at Bar-Ilan University.

## Design specification
* VDD = 1.8[V]
* TC < 10 PPM
* Vref = 1[V]
* Ibias = 10[uA]
* Pdiss < 200uW
* dT (Temperature range) = -10:110[C]
